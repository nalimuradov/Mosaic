How to use:
 - Enter a username and password (anything works as long as you enter something).
 - Click on a course in the list to the right.
 - Clicking on enroll will add it to your weekly schedule displayed to the left.
 - Click on the course in your weekly schedule to see the course info.
 - In the course info, you can drop the course or swap into another course.

Important Notes:
 - You can only swap into SFWR 4AA4 therefore if you are currently enrolled in it, no swap options will be available to you.
 - The course SFWR 4HC3 can conflict with the friday COMP SCI 4E03 lab. This is to demonstrate how our system handles course conflicts.
